CapsLockTools
=============

Clinical system-agnostic AutoHotKey script for GPs, especially locums who use different systems all the time but want a common toolset.

* disables Caps Lock, replacing it with Case-change tool menu
* adds auto-correct for commonly mis-spelled English words
* adds auto-expansion of common medical acronyms and 'auto-consults' for things like 'Failed telephone consultation'
* other hotkeys and acronyms can be added.
